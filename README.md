**TourismSystem - Explore the World with Code 🌍**
Welcome to TourismSystem, your passport to a seamless travel experience in the world of C# console applications! This prototype project is a powerful tourism management system that leverages the elegance of design patterns to create an efficient and user-friendly travel solution.

Key Features 🚀

1. **Singleton Pattern:** Our admin module is a Singleton object, ensuring a single point of control and coordination. Manage your system with unparalleled precision and security.

2. **Dependency Injection Pattern:** Seamlessly inject dependencies for managers, enhancing modularity and making your travel interactions customizable and extendable.

3. **Factory Design Pattern:** Introducing "Journey Hub," the backbone of our system. The Factory Design Pattern ensures the dynamic creation of objects, allowing you to manage entities effortlessly. Craft your travel experiences with the robust architecture provided by Journey Hub.

Special thanks to [@reyanhassan](https://github.com/reyanhassan). for invaluable contributions to the Dependency Injection's template and logic.

Note: This project is backend-focused without a graphical user interface (GUI). It highlights robust backend operations using C# and design patterns for efficient tourism management.
